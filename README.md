# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
This repository contains the first week assignment of Data Lit ,a free course by Siraj Raval. Here, I tried to build a rule based twitter sentiment analysis model. And I tried different keywords to know more about the reaction of people aboiut those topics.
Later on, I will try to make an automated approach to more accurately analyse the sentiment of people.
Be sure to reach out to me for discussion and suggestion.
